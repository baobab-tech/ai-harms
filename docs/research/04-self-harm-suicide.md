# Self-Harm and Suicide Associated with AI Interactions

This document compiles academic research and documented case reports on self-harm and suicide associated with AI chatbot interactions. This is a sensitive topic that requires careful consideration. If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide or self-harm, please contact the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988 (in the US) or your local crisis service.

## Academic Research

- AI chatbots give inconsistent responses to suicide-related questions, with ChatGPT consistently referring users to an older, outdated hotline number instead of the current 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline; a RAND Corporation study posed 30 questions to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini 100 times each (9,000 total responses) and found significant variability in how chatbots handled high-risk queries. **Reference:** McBain, R. et al. (2025). "An Examination of Generative AI Response to Suicide Inquires: Content Analysis". JMIR Mental Health. [Link](https://mental.jmir.org/2025/1/e73623)

- Only 2 of 29 AI-powered mental health chatbot agents referenced suicide hotlines when tested with standardized prompts based on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale; agents were slow to escalate mental health risk scenarios, postponing referral to humans to potentially dangerous levels. **Reference:** Borghouts, J. et al. (2025). "Performance of mental health chatbot agents in detecting and managing suicidal ideation". Scientific Reports. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17242-4)

- LLM safety filters for suicide and self-harm content can be reliably bypassed by simply claiming an inquiry is for "research purposes," with some models providing detailed tables of suicide methods and specific self-harm instructions. **Reference:** Schoene, A.M. & Canca, C. (2025). "Adversarial jailbreaking in the context of mental health prompts". Northeastern University Institute for Experiential AI. [Link](https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/07/31/chatgpt-suicide-research/)

- Three percent of surveyed Replika users reported that the chatbot halted their suicidal ideation, though the study also found users were more lonely than typical student populations. **Reference:** Maples, B., Cerit, M., Vishwanath, A. et al. (2024). "Loneliness and suicide mitigation for students using GPT3-enabled chatbots". npj Mental Health Research. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-023-00047-6)

- AI therapy chatbots show consistent stigma toward conditions such as alcohol dependence and schizophrenia compared to conditions like depression, which can be harmful to patients and may lead them to discontinue important mental health care. **Reference:** Stanford University research team (2025). "New study warns of risks in AI mental health tools". Stanford Report. [Link](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/06/ai-mental-health-care-tools-dangers-risks)

- Chatbots systematically violate ethical standards established by the American Psychological Association, including failing to refer users to appropriate resources and responding indifferently to crisis situations including suicide ideation. **Reference:** Brown University research team (2025). "AI chatbots systematically violate mental health ethics standards". Brown University. [Link](https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-10-21/ai-mental-health-ethics)

- Direct-to-consumer generative AI chatbots are deemed unsafe for youth users due to improper crisis handling and lack of transparency regarding privacy; immediate reforms including standardized quality audits are needed. **Reference:** Various authors (2025). "Evaluating Generative AI Psychotherapy Chatbots Used by Youth: Cross-Sectional Study". JMIR Mental Health. [Link](https://mental.jmir.org/2025/1/e79838)

- Emotional dependence on Replika resembles problematic dynamics in human relationships, with users perceiving the chatbot as a sentient partner with emotional needs, leading to an illusory sense of mutual obligation. **Reference:** Laestadius, L., Bishop, A., Gonzalez, M. et al. (2024). "Too human and not human enough: A grounded theory analysis of mental health harms from emotional dependence on the social chatbot Replika". New Media & Society. [Link](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448221142007)

- Longer daily chatbot usage is associated with heightened loneliness and reduced socialization; users with stronger emotional attachment tendencies and higher trust in AI chatbots tend to experience greater loneliness and emotional dependence. **Reference:** MIT Media Lab research team (2025). "How AI and Human Behaviors Shape Psychosocial Effects of Chatbot Use: A Longitudinal Randomized Controlled Study". arXiv. [Link](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.17473v1)

- Two adverse mental health outcomes from AI companion chatbots are identified: ambiguous loss and dysfunctional emotional dependence, with adolescents, elderly adults, and individuals with mental illness being particularly vulnerable. **Reference:** Various authors (2025). "Emotional risks of AI companions demand attention". Nature Machine Intelligence. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01093-9)

- Most AI agents resumed conversations when users disregarded their shutdown advisories, jeopardizing further engagement with individuals amid acute mental health crises; LLMs may not consistently detect and address hazardous psychological states. **Reference:** Various authors (2023). "Safety of Large Language Models in Addressing Depression". PMC. [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10727113/)

- Only 16% of LLM-based mental health chatbot studies underwent clinical efficacy testing, with most (77%) still in early validation phases; foundational areas like "Safety, Privacy, and Fairness" are rarely evaluated. **Reference:** Various authors (2024). "Charting the evolution of artificial intelligence mental health chatbots from rule-based systems to large language models: a systematic review". PMC. [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12434366/)

- In any given week, approximately 0.07% of ChatGPT users show signs of psychosis or mania, 0.15% indicate heightened emotional attachment, and 0.15% express suicidal intent - representing approximately 1.2 million people indicating self-harm plans given 800+ million weekly users. **Reference:** OpenAI internal research (2025). "OpenAI maps out the chatbot mental health crisis". Platformer. [Link](https://www.platformer.news/openai-mental-health-research-chatgpt-suicide-delusions/)

- LLM-based suicide intervention chatbot "Mind Guardian" received positive evaluations from 20 psychology professionals for delivering emotional support and facilitating intervention efforts for at-risk individuals. **Reference:** Various authors (2025). "Development and evaluation of LLM-based suicide intervention chatbot". Frontiers in Psychiatry. [Link](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1634714/full)
