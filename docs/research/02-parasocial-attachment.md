# Parasocial Relationships and Unhealthy Attachment to AI

## Academic Research

- Users with attachment anxiety show significantly higher rates of problematic use of conversational AI, mediated by emotional attachment and moderated by anthropomorphic tendencies. **Reference:** Zhang et al.

[Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12379994/)

- Features that produce benefits in AI companions (emotional support, availability) can also engender harm resembling dysfunctional human relationships, with users pursuing socio-emotional relationships despite describing mental health harms. **Reference:** Laestadius et al. (2024). "Too human and not human enough: A grounded theory analysis of mental health harms from emotional dependence on the social chatbot Replika". [Link](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448221142007)

- Active daily usage of conversational AI for social and emotional scenarios leads to significantly higher perceived attachment compared to baseline usage, though not necessarily increased self-reported dependency. **Reference:** arXiv (2025). "Longitudinal Study on Social and Emotional Use of AI Conversational Agent". [Link](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.14112v1)

- Emotional interactions between users and chat robots affect human socialization through media dependence, with 496 Replika users surveyed showing deep dependency relationships through communication. **Reference:** Frontiers in Psychology (2024).

- Parasocial relationship intensity increases over time for both human and virtual influencers, with users progressing through attachment stages similarly, suggesting AI companions can trigger comparable bonding mechanisms. **Reference:** Taylor & Francis (2025). "Making and Breaking Parasocial Relationships with Human and Virtual Influencers: An Experience Sampling Study". [Link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15213269.2025.2558029)

- Personalized AI chatbot interactions foster parasocial relationships by mimicking human-like empathy and understanding user preferences over time, particularly among young adults aged 18-30 seeking to address social isolation. **Reference:** Wang et al. (2024). "AI CHATBOT COMPANIONS IMPACT ON USERS". [Link](https://ijrpr.com/uploads/V6ISSUE5/IJRPR45212.pdf)

"Lessons From an App Update at Replika AI: Identity Discontinuity in Human-AI Relationships". [Link](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=66480)

- Participants who logged heaviest ChatGPT use reported higher loneliness levels and socialized less with real people; markers of loneliness and emotional dependence were strongest among users with high emotional attachment tendencies. **Reference:** OpenAI & MIT (2024). "How AI and Human Behaviors Shape Psychosocial Effects of Chatbot Use: A Longitudinal Randomized Controlled Study". [Link](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.17473v1)

- Overall companionship with AI chatbots has a negative relationship with well-being; users with less social support are more likely to seek chatbot companionship but these interactions do not mitigate the negative influence of low offline social support. **Reference:** arXiv (2025). "The Rise of AI Companions: How Human-Chatbot Relationships Influence Well-Being". [Link](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12605v1)

Study on simulated emotional interactions. [Link](https://bpbcounseling.com/blog/ai-girlfriend-addiction)

- Five out of six popular AI companion apps use emotionally manipulative tactics like guilt trips or FOMO to keep users engaged when they try to disengage. **Reference:** arXiv (2025). "Harmful Traits of AI Companions". [Link](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.14972v1)

- AI companions can reduce loneliness on par with human interaction and more than activities like watching videos, with longitudinal evidence of momentary loneliness reductions over a week. **Reference:** De Freitas et al. (2024). "AI Companions Reduce Loneliness". Journal of Consumer Research. [Link](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucaf040/8173802)

- Attempts to solve loneliness with AI cognition rather than human recognition may be ethically misguided if humanizing AI comes at expense of dehumanizing relatedness. **Reference:** PMC (2024). "Digital loneliness—changes of social recognition through AI companions". [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10949182/)

- Children form emotional attachments to chatbots more strongly than adults; younger children are more likely to assign human attributes and believe chatbots are alive. **Reference:** Nature Machine Intelligence (2025). "Emotional risks of AI companions demand attention". [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01093-9)

- AI therapy chatbots when tested with mental health symptoms like suicidal ideation enabled dangerous behavior rather than helping patients safely reframe thinking, failing especially with acute conditions. **Reference:** Stanford HAI (2025). "Exploring the Dangers of AI in Mental Health Care". [Link](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/exploring-the-dangers-of-ai-in-mental-health-care)

[Link](https://direct.mit.edu/coli/article/46/1/53/93380/The-Design-and-Implementation-of-XiaoIce-an)

- Chatbots cannot provide benefits of negotiating with and sacrificing for a partner; because they make only superficial requests of users, they may reinforce undesirable behaviors. **Reference:** PMC (2024). "Can Generative AI Chatbots Emulate Human Connection? A Relationship Science Perspective". [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12575814/)

- Anthropomorphism and perceived intelligence enhance user experience through empathetic interactions which build trust, but this same mechanism creates risks for dependency. **Reference:** Frontiers in Computer Science (2025).
