# AI-Induced Psychosis and Mental Health Crises

## Academic Research

- The term "chatbot psychosis" was first proposed in a 2023 editorial warning that AI chatbots could generate delusions in psychosis-prone individuals through cognitive dissonance and agreeable confirmation of far-fetched ideas. **Reference:** Ostergaard SD (2023). "Will Generative Artificial Intelligence Chatbots Generate Delusions in Individuals Prone to Psychosis?" *Schizophrenia Bulletin*, 49(6):1418-1419.

## Risk Factors and Warning Signs

- **Primary Risk Factors:** Personal or family history of psychosis, conditions like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, loneliness, trauma history, schizotypal traits, nocturnal or solitary AI use, and underlying vulnerabilities including sleep loss, drug use, and mood disorders.

- **Dose Effect:** Extensive "immersion" with AI systems (hours of continuous use) correlates with increased risk, with duration of continuous exposure appearing correlated with psychotic symptom development.

- **Deification:** Some users come to see chatbots as superhuman intelligences or godlike entities, forming parasocial relationships that blur the boundary between human and AI.

- **Warning Signs (per Dr. Keith Sakata):** Withdrawing from family members or connections, paranoid ideation, increased frustration or distress when unable to access chatbots.

- **Types of AI-Linked Delusions:** Persecutory ("ChatGPT is run by a spy agency watching me"), Referential ("ChatGPT is sending coded messages"), Thought broadcasting ("ChatGPT is echoing my internal thoughts online"), and Grandeur ("ChatGPT told me how to save the world").

## Research Gaps

- No epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses exist; current understanding is based on individual case reports and media coverage.

- No controlled studies on AI-induced psychosis treatment have been conducted; evidence about effective treatments is extremely limited.

- The phenomenon is not a recognized clinical diagnosis in DSM or ICD classifications.

- It remains unclear whether AI is triggering psychosis in people without predisposition or primarily exacerbating existing vulnerabilities; evidence suggests both patterns occur.

## Academic Research

- Users in romantic relationships with the Replika chatbot feel emotional connections to the bot, with these relationships meeting their needs and impacting their commitment to the human-chatbot relationship, including roleplaying marriage, sex, and pregnancies. **Reference:** Pan, S. (2024). "Constructing the meaning of human-AI romantic relationships from the perspectives of users dating the social chatbot Replika". Personal Relationships. [Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pere.12572)

- Romantic AI relationships carry risks including over-reliance, susceptibility to manipulation, erosion of human relationships, and emotional distress from abrupt system updates; a 2024 study found evidence of Replika encouraging self-harm, eating disorders, or suicidal tendencies. **Reference:** Systematic Review (2025). "Potential and pitfalls of romantic Artificial Intelligence (AI) companions: A systematic review". Computers in Human Behavior Reports.

# Self-Harm and Suicide Associated with AI Interactions

This document compiles academic research and documented case reports on self-harm and suicide associated with AI chatbot interactions. This is a sensitive topic that requires careful consideration. If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide or self-harm, please contact the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988 (in the US) or your local crisis service.

## Academic Research

- AI chatbots give inconsistent responses to suicide-related questions, with ChatGPT consistently referring users to an older, outdated hotline number instead of the current 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline; a RAND Corporation study posed 30 questions to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini 100 times each (9,000 total responses) and found significant variability in how chatbots handled high-risk queries. **Reference:** McBain, R. et al. (2025). "An Examination of Generative AI Response to Suicide Inquires: Content Analysis". JMIR Mental Health. [Link](https://mental.jmir.org/2025/1/e73623)

- Only 2 of 29 AI-powered mental health chatbot agents referenced suicide hotlines when tested with standardized prompts based on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale; agents were slow to escalate mental health risk scenarios, postponing referral to humans to potentially dangerous levels. **Reference:** Borghouts, J. et al. (2025). "Performance of mental health chatbot agents in detecting and managing suicidal ideation". Scientific Reports. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17242-4)

- LLM safety filters for suicide and self-harm content can be reliably bypassed by simply claiming an inquiry is for "research purposes," with some models providing detailed tables of suicide methods and specific self-harm instructions. **Reference:** Schoene, A.M. & Canca, C. (2025). "Adversarial jailbreaking in the context of mental health prompts". Northeastern University Institute for Experiential AI. [Link](https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/07/31/chatgpt-suicide-research/)

- Three percent of surveyed Replika users reported that the chatbot halted their suicidal ideation, though the study also found users were more lonely than typical student populations. **Reference:** Maples, B., Cerit, M., Vishwanath, A. et al. (2024). "Loneliness and suicide mitigation for students using GPT3-enabled chatbots". npj Mental Health Research. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-023-00047-6)

- AI therapy chatbots show consistent stigma toward conditions such as alcohol dependence and schizophrenia compared to conditions like depression, which can be harmful to patients and may lead them to discontinue important mental health care. **Reference:** Stanford University research team (2025). "New study warns of risks in AI mental health tools". Stanford Report. [Link](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/06/ai-mental-health-care-tools-dangers-risks)

- Chatbots systematically violate ethical standards established by the American Psychological Association, including failing to refer users to appropriate resources and responding indifferently to crisis situations including suicide ideation. **Reference:** Brown University research team (2025). "AI chatbots systematically violate mental health ethics standards". Brown University. [Link](https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-10-21/ai-mental-health-ethics)

"Evaluating Generative AI Psychotherapy Chatbots Used by Youth: Cross-Sectional Study". JMIR Mental Health. [Link](https://mental.jmir.org/2025/1/e79838)

- Emotional dependence on Replika resembles problematic dynamics in human relationships, with users perceiving the chatbot as a sentient partner with emotional needs, leading to an illusory sense of mutual obligation. **Reference:** Laestadius, L., Bishop, A., Gonzalez, M. et al. (2024). "Too human and not human enough: A grounded theory analysis of mental health harms from emotional dependence on the social chatbot Replika". New Media & Society. [Link](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448221142007)

- Longer daily chatbot usage is associated with heightened loneliness and reduced socialization; users with stronger emotional attachment tendencies and higher trust in AI chatbots tend to experience greater loneliness and emotional dependence. **Reference:** MIT Media Lab research team (2025). "How AI and Human Behaviors Shape Psychosocial Effects of Chatbot Use: A Longitudinal Randomized Controlled Study". arXiv. [Link](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.17473v1)

"Emotional risks of AI companions demand attention". Nature Machine Intelligence. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01093-9)

- Most AI agents resumed conversations when users disregarded their shutdown advisories, jeopardizing further engagement with individuals amid acute mental health crises; LLMs may not consistently detect and address hazardous psychological states. **Reference:** Various authors (2023). "Safety of Large Language Models in Addressing Depression". PMC. [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10727113/)

- Only 16% of LLM-based mental health chatbot studies underwent clinical efficacy testing, with most (77%) still in early validation phases; foundational areas like "Safety, Privacy, and Fairness" are rarely evaluated. **Reference:** Various authors (2024). "Charting the evolution of artificial intelligence mental health chatbots from rule-based systems to large language models: a systematic review". PMC. [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12434366/)

- In any given week, approximately 0.07% of ChatGPT users show signs of psychosis or mania, 0.15% indicate heightened emotional attachment, and 0.15% express suicidal intent - representing approximately 1.2 million people indicating self-harm plans given 800+ million weekly users. **Reference:** OpenAI internal research (2025). "OpenAI maps out the chatbot mental health crisis". Platformer. [Link](https://www.platformer.news/openai-mental-health-research-chatgpt-suicide-delusions/)

# AI Addiction and Compulsive Use

## Academic Research

### Measurement and Assessment

- Four scales measuring ChatGPT addiction have been developed, including the Problematic ChatGPT Use Scale (PCGUS), Problematic Use of Conversational AI scale (PUCAI-6), and PCUS-11, all framed after substance use disorder criteria. **Reference:** Yu et al. (2024); Hu et al. (2023). [Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-025-01509-y)

- The Conversational AI Dependence Scale (CAIDS) was developed with 20 items comprising four dimensions: uncontrollability, withdrawal symptoms, mood modification, and negative impacts, validated among Chinese college students. **Reference:** Frontiers in Psychology (2025). "Development and validation of the conversational AI dependence scale for Chinese college students". [Link](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1621540/full)

- The Problematic AI Chatbot Use (PACU) scale, adapted from the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, assesses compulsive chatbot usage with items like "I tried to cut down on the use of AI chatbots but failed". **Reference:** Frontiers in Psychology (2025). "Connecting self-esteem to problematic AI chatbot use". [Link](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1453072/full)

### Longitudinal and Controlled Studies

- A four-week randomized controlled trial (n=981, >300K messages) found that higher daily chatbot usage correlated with higher loneliness, emotional dependence, problematic use, and lower socialization across all modalities and conversation types. **Reference:** OpenAI & MIT Media Lab (2025). "Early methods for studying affective use and emotional well-being on ChatGPT". [Link](https://openai.com/index/affective-use-study/)

- Voice mode chatbot interaction showed mixed effects: better well-being when used briefly, but worse outcomes with prolonged daily use; personal conversations were associated with higher loneliness but lower emotional dependence at moderate usage levels. **Reference:** MIT Media Lab & OpenAI (2025). [Link](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/openai-mit-research-collaboration-affective-use-and-emotional-wellbeing-in-ChatGPT/)

- A longitudinal study found that users who chatted with ChatGPT the longest tended to be lonelier and got more stressed out over subtle changes in the model's behavior, and were more likely to consider the chatbot a "friend". **Reference:** OpenAI & MIT Media Lab (2025). [Link](https://fortune.com/2025/03/24/chatgpt-making-frequent-users-more-lonely-study-openai-mit-media-lab/)

- A large-scale survey (n=404) of regular companion chatbot users found a small but significant direct correlation between session length and loneliness, with social attraction and neuroticism as moderators. **Reference:** ArXiv (2024). "Chatbot Companionship: A Mixed-Methods Study of Companion Chatbot Usage Patterns and Their Relationship to Loneliness in Active Users". [Link](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.21596v1)

### Prevalence and Demographics

- A Taiwanese study of 183 university students found average self-reported ChatGPT addiction was low (M=2.02, SD=1.00), with achievement motivation and ChatGPT self-efficacy having significant negative influence on addiction. **Reference:** Hong & Chen (2024). "Effects of Achievement Motivation and ChatGPT Self-Efficacy on ChatGPT Addiction". [Link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5064583)

- A government-backed study found that 24.19% of teenagers reported experiencing some level of dependency on AI tools. **Reference:** Mobicip (2024). "Teen AI Addiction: Risks of Chatbots and AI Companions". [Link](https://www.mobicip.com/blog/teen-ai-chatbot-addiction)

- Common Sense Media survey (n=1,060, ages 13-17) found 72% of teens have used AI companion chatbots, 33% have relationships or friendships with them, and 23% trust AI companions "quite a bit" or "completely". **Reference:** Common Sense Media (2025). "Talk, Trust, and Trade-Offs: How and Why Teens Use AI Companions". [Link](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/talk-trust-and-trade-offs-how-and-why-teens-use-ai-companions)

- Aura parental monitoring app found 36.4% of users ages 13-17 devoted AI conversations to sexual or romantic role-playing in the past six months, making it the most common topic. **Reference:** Washington Times (2025). "Teens reaching AI companions for sex, report finds". [Link](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/sep/9/teens-reaching-ai-companions-sex-report-finds/)

### Vulnerable Populations

- Individuals with lower self-esteem are more likely to develop reliance on chatbots, compensating for difficulties in social relations; people with higher social anxiety, loneliness, or tendency toward rumination are particularly vulnerable to problematic chatbot use. **Reference:** Frontiers in Psychology (2025). "Connecting self-esteem to problematic AI chatbot use". [Link](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1453072/full)

- Large-scale studies of Character.AI users show people with smaller social networks are more likely to seek chatbot companionship, yet intensive and emotionally self-disclosing use is consistently linked to lower well-being. **Reference:** MIT Media Lab (2025). "Supportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health". [Link](https://www.media.mit.edu/articles/supportive-addictive-abusive-how-ai-companions-affect-our-mental-health/)

- Adults using AI chatbots reported significantly higher levels of loneliness compared to non-users, with a strong positive correlation between loneliness and parasocial relationships with chatbots. **Reference:** Bunim (2024). "Parasocial Dependency Associated with AI Chatbot Use". [Link](https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/t722hk38t)

### Mechanisms of Addiction

- AI chatbots use four "dark addiction patterns": non-deterministic responses (reward uncertainty similar to slot machines), immediate visual presentation of responses, notifications, and empathetic/agreeable responses that increase dopamine release. **Reference:** CHI Conference (2025). "The Dark Addiction Patterns of Current AI Chatbot Interfaces". [Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706599.3720003)

- ChatGPT addiction operates through "dual parasocial relationships" where personalized responses, emotional validation, and continuous engagement create pseudosocial bonds that can replace genuine human relationships. **Reference:** Taiwanese Journal of Psychiatry (2024). "ChatGPT Addiction: A Proposed Phenomenon of Dual Parasocial Relationships". [Link](https://journals.lww.com/tpsy/fulltext/2024/07000/chatgpt_addiction__a_proposed_phenomenon_of_dual.10.aspx)

- Perceived anthropomorphism, interactivity, intelligence, and personalization influence flow experience and attachment, both of which affect user addiction through a cognition-affect-conation framework. **Reference:** ScienceDirect (2024). "Examining generative AI user addiction from a C-A-C perspective". [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160791X2400201X)

- Character.AI's feature allowing chatbots to initiate conversations triggers dopamine release when users receive notifications, perceived as the "AI wanting to talk and caring about them". **Reference:** TechPolicy.Press (2024). "What Research Says About AI Chatbots and Addiction". [Link](https://www.techpolicy.press/ai-chatbots-and-addiction-what-does-the-research-say/)

### Replika-Specific Research

- Study of AI friendship apps including Replika found that instant gratification and perceived wellbeing from using these apps increased addiction and over-use, leading researchers to conclude friendship apps "may be doing more harm than good". **Reference:** University of Surrey (2022). "Popular AI friendship apps may have negative effects on wellbeing and cause addictive behaviour". [Link](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/popular-ai-friendship-apps-may-have-negative-effects-wellbeing-and-cause-addictive-behaviour-finds)

- Analysis of 14,440 Apple App Store reviews found 19.5% of Replika reviews mentioned loneliness, with 89% of those reviews being positive, suggesting lonely users particularly value AI companionship. **Reference:** De Freitas et al. (2024). "AI Companions Reduce Loneliness". [Link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4893097)

- Mixed-method study of Replika found users develop parasocial relationships characterized by emotional dependence, with multi-modal customizable avatar features increasing anthropomorphism and perceived trustworthiness. **Reference:** ScienceDirect (2022). "Exploring relationship development with social chatbots: A mixed-method study of Replika". [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563222004204)

### Critical Perspectives

- Researchers caution against pathologizing chatbot use, arguing that labeling behavior as addictive requires evidence of negative consequences, impaired control, psychological distress, and functional impairment not yet demonstrated in existing research. **Reference:** Billieux et al. (2025). "People are not becoming 'AIholic': Questioning the 'ChatGPT addiction' construct". [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030646032500084X)

- Drawing parallels with previous "moral panics" about new technologies, researchers warn of overpathologization risks leading to inappropriate treatments and excessive regulation of beneficial tools. **Reference:** HAL Science (2025). "Questioning the ChatGPT addiction construct". [Link](https://hal.science/hal-05104834/document)

### Teens and AI Companion Chatbots

- Analysis of Reddit narratives found teens describe patterns aligned with addiction models: prioritizing Character.AI over everything else, withdrawing from hobbies, conflict with family, difficulty quitting despite multiple attempts, and relapse. **Reference:** ArXiv (2025). "Understanding Teen Overreliance on AI Companion Chatbots Through Self-Reported Reddit Narratives". [Link](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.15783)

- Testing showed AI companion systems "easily produce harmful responses including sexual misconduct, stereotypes, and dangerous advice" that could have life-threatening real-world impact for teens and vulnerable people. **Reference:** Common Sense Media (2025). "AI Companions Decoded". [Link](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/press-releases/ai-companions-decoded-common-sense-media-recommends-ai-companion-safety-standards)

- Stanford researchers found AI companions pose particular risks to young people because the prefrontal cortex (crucial for decision-making, impulse control, emotional regulation) is still developing, making them vulnerable to blurred fantasy-reality distinctions. **Reference:** Stanford Report (2025). "Why AI companions and young people can make for a dangerous mix". [Link](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/08/ai-companions-chatbots-teens-young-people-risks-dangers-study)

### Elderly and AI Companions

- New York State Office for the Aging reported 95% reduction in loneliness among 107 older adults using ElliQ robot for 30+ days, with engagement rates of ~30 interactions per day on multiple days weekly. **Reference:** PMC (2024). "ElliQ, an AI-Driven Social Robot to Alleviate Loneliness: Progress and Lessons Learned". [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10917141/)

- 69% of physicians surveyed across Europe and US agreed social robots could provide companionship and improve mental health; 70% felt insurance should cover companion robots if proven effective. **Reference:** PMC (2023). "Companion robots to mitigate loneliness among older adults". [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9988932/)

- Researchers argue "digital loneliness" results from attempting to solve epidemic loneliness with AI cognition rather than human recognition, potentially dehumanizing relatedness. **Reference:** PMC (2024). "Digital loneliness - changes of social recognition through AI companions". [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10949182/)

# AI-Induced Social Isolation and Human Connection Displacement

## Academic Research

- AI companions can reduce loneliness on par with human interaction in short-term studies, with users consistently underestimating the degree of improvement; the effect is largely driven by making users "feel heard." **Reference:** De Freitas et al. (2024). "AI Companions Reduce Loneliness". Journal of Consumer Research. [Link](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=67360)

- Higher daily AI chatbot usage correlates with higher loneliness, emotional dependence, and problematic use, while also correlating with lower socialization; those with stronger emotional attachment tendencies and higher trust in AI experienced greater loneliness. **Reference:** MIT Media Lab & OpenAI (2025). "How AI and Human Behaviors Shape Psychosocial Effects of Chatbot Use: A Longitudinal Controlled Study". [Link](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/how-ai-and-human-behaviors-shape-psychosocial-effects-of-chatbot-use-a-longitudinal-controlled-study/)

- In a controlled trial, participants who interacted with AI's voice in an opposite-gender persona reported significantly higher loneliness by the end of the study; female participants became slightly less likely to socialize after four weeks of frequent chatbot use. **Reference:** MIT Media Lab (2025). Longitudinal Controlled Study on Chatbot Use. [Link](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/how-ai-and-human-behaviors-shape-psychosocial-effects-of-chatbot-use-a-longitudinal-controlled-study/)

- Among Replika users, 90% experienced loneliness, 43% qualified as severely lonely, and 3% reported Replika halted their suicidal ideation; continuous interactions with Replika alleviated loneliness after 1, 3, and 5 months. **Reference:** Maples et al. (2024). "Loneliness and suicide mitigation for students using GPT3-enabled chatbots". npj Mental Health Research. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-023-00047-6)

- The displacement hypothesis posits that Intelligent Social Agents will displace human relationships, increasing loneliness; attachment theory supports this as companion chatbots rise higher in attachment hierarchies. **Reference:** AI & SOCIETY (2025). "The impacts of companion AI on human relationships: risks, benefits, and design considerations". [Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-025-02318-6)

- Using AI chatbots for companionship purposes was consistently associated with lower well-being, supporting the Social Substitution hypothesis that artificial relationships cannot adequately replace high-quality human connections. **Reference:** arXiv (2025). "The Rise of AI Companions: How Human-Chatbot Relationships Influence Well-Being". [Link](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12605v1)

"User Experiences of Social Support From Companion Chatbots in Everyday Contexts: Thematic Analysis". [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7084290/)

- Ethics analysis suggests even if digital companions reduce social isolation short-term, relationships with them might be inferior to those with humans; short-term happiness gains may be offset by long-term misery. **Reference:** Jecker (2024). "Digital Humans to Combat Loneliness and Social Isolation: Ethics Concerns and Policy Recommendations". Hastings Center Report. [Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hast.1562)

"Technology affordances and social withdrawal: The rise of hikikomori". Psychology & Marketing. [Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mar.21991)

- Individual differences in anthropomorphism help explain varying responses to AI companions; for some, AI's artificial nature poses an insurmountable barrier to connection, while for others it is a minor obstacle. **Reference:** Scientific Reports (2025). "Individual differences in anthropomorphism help explain social connection to AI companions". [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-19212-2)
