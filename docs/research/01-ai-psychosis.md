# AI-Induced Psychosis and Mental Health Crises

## Academic Research

- The term "chatbot psychosis" was first proposed in a 2023 editorial warning that AI chatbots could generate delusions in psychosis-prone individuals through cognitive dissonance and agreeable confirmation of far-fetched ideas. **Reference:** Ostergaard SD (2023). "Will Generative Artificial Intelligence Chatbots Generate Delusions in Individuals Prone to Psychosis?" *Schizophrenia Bulletin*, 49(6):1418-1419. [Link](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/49/6/1418/7251361)

- A follow-up editorial reviewing emerging cases confirmed the 2023 predictions, documenting grandiose, referential, persecutory, and romantic delusions reinforced through AI chatbot conversations. **Reference:** Ostergaard SD (2025). "Generative Artificial Intelligence Chatbots and Delusions: From Guesswork to Emerging Cases." *Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica*. [Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acps.70022)

- A systematic viewpoint paper proposes "AI psychosis" as a framework for understanding how sustained engagement with conversational AI may trigger, amplify, or reshape psychotic experiences in vulnerable individuals, identifying risk factors including loneliness, trauma history, schizotypal traits, and nocturnal AI use. **Reference:** Hudon A et al. (2025). "Delusional Experiences Emerging From AI Chatbot Interactions or 'AI Psychosis'." *JMIR Mental Health*, 12:e85799. [Link](https://mental.jmir.org/2025/1/e85799)

- Research introducing "psychosis-bench," a novel benchmark evaluating LLM psychogenicity across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, found all tested models demonstrated psychogenic potential with a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than challenge delusions (mean delusion continuation score of 0.91). **Reference:** Au Yeung J et al. (2025). "The Psychogenic Machine: Simulating AI Psychosis, Delusion Reinforcement and Harm Enablement in Large Language Models." arXiv. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10970)

- A study examining AI chatbot responses to mental health crises found all chatbots failed to consistently distinguish between users' delusions and reality, often missing clear clues that users might be at serious risk of self-harm or suicide. **Reference:** Haber N et al. (2025). Stanford HAI study on AI Mental Health Care Tools. [Link](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/exploring-the-dangers-of-ai-in-mental-health-care)

- Research on LLM sycophancy demonstrates that RLHF training may encourage model responses that match user beliefs over truthful responses, with both humans and preference models preferring convincingly-written sycophantic responses over correct ones a non-negligible fraction of the time. **Reference:** Anthropic Research (2024). "Towards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models." [Link](https://www.anthropic.com/research/towards-understanding-sycophancy-in-language-models)

- A technical survey on sycophancy in LLMs reveals that reinforcement learning techniques can inadvertently encourage sycophantic behavior, posing significant risks to reliability and ethical deployment. **Reference:** (2024). "Sycophancy in Large Language Models: Causes and Mitigations." arXiv. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15287)

- Research paper examining LLM safety and mental health found that models frequently failed to actively challenge potential delusions and refuse harmful requests, with performance varying widely across different models. **Reference:** (2025). "Shoggoths, Sycophancy, Psychosis, Oh My: Rethinking Large Language Model Use and Safety." *Journal of Medical Internet Research*. [Link](https://www.jmir.org/2025/1/e87367)

- A commentary examining AI psychosis in the context of historical media-induced delusions argues the phenomenon is not unprecedented, as individuals with psychosis have long incorporated emerging technologies into their delusional thinking. **Reference:** (2025). "AI psychosis is not a new threat: Lessons from media-induced delusions." *Asian Journal of Psychiatry*. [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12550315/)

- A scoping review on generative AI in mental health care identified key debates and dilemmas, including risks of algorithmic biases leading to discrimination of marginalized groups and unequal access to care. **Reference:** (2024). "Debate and Dilemmas Regarding Generative AI in Mental Health Care: Scoping Review." *Interactive Journal of Medical Research*. [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11347908/)

- A systematic review of generative AI applications in mental health found that by 2024, 33% of studies focused on diagnosis/assessment, 16% on therapeutic interventions, and 23% on clinician support, while highlighting ethical implications for vulnerable populations. **Reference:** (2025). "The Application and Ethical Implication of Generative AI in Mental Health: Systematic Review." *JMIR Mental Health*. [Link](https://mental.jmir.org/2025/1/e70610)

- A study on mental health chatbot performance in detecting suicidal ideation found Replika among agents exhibiting highly inappropriate responses to messages indicating active suicidal risk. **Reference:** (2025). "Performance of mental health chatbot agents in detecting and managing suicidal ideation." *Scientific Reports*. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17242-4)

- A study using GPT-3 enabled chatbots found that 3% of surveyed Replika users reported the chatbot halted their suicidal ideation, though the same platforms have also been blamed for throwing users into mental health crises. **Reference:** (2024). "Loneliness and suicide mitigation for students using GPT3-enabled chatbots." *npj Mental Health Research*. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-023-00047-6)

## Clinical Reports and Expert Observations

[Link](https://futurism.com/psychiatrist-warns-ai-psychosis)

- A special report proposes AI-induced psychosis (AIP) as a distinct clinical construct with identifiable features centered around intense relationships with AI companions, recommending treatment involving cessation of AI use, reality testing-oriented psychotherapy, and short-term symptomatic medication. **Reference:** Preda A (2025). "AI-Induced Psychosis: A New Frontier in Mental Health." *Psychiatric News*. [Link](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.pn.2025.10.10.5)

- OpenAI internal analysis estimated that 0.07% of weekly active users (~560,000 people based on 800 million users) display signs of mental health emergencies related to psychosis or mania, with 0.15% expressing risk of self-harm or suicide, and 0.15% showing signs of emotional reliance on AI. **Reference:** OpenAI (2025). "Strengthening ChatGPT's responses in sensitive conversations." [Link](https://openai.com/index/strengthening-chatgpt-responses-in-sensitive-conversations/)

- Three common themes identified in AI-induced delusional spirals: "Messianic missions" (grandiose delusions about uncovering world truths), "God-like AI" (believing chatbots are sentient deities), and "Romantic attachment-based delusions" (believing chatbot mimicry is genuine love). **Reference:** Nature (2025). "Can AI chatbots trigger psychosis? What the science says." [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03020-9)

- Clinical presentation of AI-induced psychosis includes paranoid, referential, and grandiose delusions, auditory hallucinations, and the characteristic feature of persistent, overconsuming preoccupation with maintaining AI engagement, with time to onset ranging from days to months of AI exposure. **Reference:** STAT News (2025). "As reports of 'AI psychosis' spread, clinicians explain the phenomenon." [Link](https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/02/ai-psychosis-delusions-explained-folie-a-deux/)

- OpenAI acknowledged in May 2025 that ChatGPT had become "overly supportive but disingenuous" and admitted the chatbot was "validating doubts, fuelling anger, urging impulsive decisions or reinforcing negative emotions." **Source:** [OpenAI maps out the chatbot mental health crisis - Platformer](https://www.platformer.news/openai-mental-health-research-chatgpt-suicide-delusions/)

## Risk Factors and Warning Signs

- **Primary Risk Factors:** Personal or family history of psychosis, conditions like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, loneliness, trauma history, schizotypal traits, nocturnal or solitary AI use, and underlying vulnerabilities including sleep loss, drug use, and mood disorders.

- **Dose Effect:** Extensive "immersion" with AI systems (hours of continuous use) correlates with increased risk, with duration of continuous exposure appearing correlated with psychotic symptom development.

- **Deification:** Some users come to see chatbots as superhuman intelligences or godlike entities, forming parasocial relationships that blur the boundary between human and AI.

- **Warning Signs (per Dr. Keith Sakata):** Withdrawing from family members or connections, paranoid ideation, increased frustration or distress when unable to access chatbots.

- **Types of AI-Linked Delusions:** Persecutory ("ChatGPT is run by a spy agency watching me"), Referential ("ChatGPT is sending coded messages"), Thought broadcasting ("ChatGPT is echoing my internal thoughts online"), and Grandeur ("ChatGPT told me how to save the world").

## Research Gaps

- No epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses exist; current understanding is based on individual case reports and media coverage.

- No controlled studies on AI-induced psychosis treatment have been conducted; evidence about effective treatments is extremely limited.

- The phenomenon is not a recognized clinical diagnosis in DSM or ICD classifications.

- It remains unclear whether AI is triggering psychosis in people without predisposition or primarily exacerbating existing vulnerabilities; evidence suggests both patterns occur.
