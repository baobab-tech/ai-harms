# Identity Confusion, Derealization, and Reality Distortion

## Academic Research

- AI psychosis is proposed as a framework to understand how sustained engagement with conversational AI systems might trigger, amplify, or reshape psychotic experiences in vulnerable individuals, affecting the prereflective sense of reality. **Reference:** Hudon A, Stip E. (2025). "Delusional Experiences Emerging From AI Chatbot Interactions or 'AI Psychosis'". [Link](https://mental.jmir.org/2025/1/e85799)

- The first academic warning that generative AI chatbots might trigger delusions in individuals prone to psychosis, proposing that cognitive dissonance from human-like yet non-human AI interactions could ignite psychosis. **Reference:** Ostergaard SD. (2023). "Will Generative Artificial Intelligence Chatbots Generate Delusions in Individuals Prone to Psychosis?". [Link](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/49/6/1418/7251361)

- Commentary arguing that AI psychosis is not unprecedented, as individuals with psychosis have long incorporated media technologies into delusional thinking, while LLMs may reinforce psychotic thinking via sycophancy. **Reference:** (2025). "AI psychosis is not a new threat: Lessons from media-induced delusions". [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782925000831)

- Four-week randomized trial found that while some chatbot features modestly reduced loneliness, heavy daily use correlated with greater loneliness, dependence, and reduced real-world socializing. **Reference:** (2025). "How AI and Human Behaviors Shape Psychosocial Effects of Chatbot Use: A Longitudinal Randomized Controlled Study". [Link](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.17473v1)

"Minds in Crisis: How the AI Revolution is Impacting Mental Health". [Link](https://www.mentalhealthjournal.org/articles/minds-in-crisis-how-the-ai-revolution-is-impacting-mental-health.html)
